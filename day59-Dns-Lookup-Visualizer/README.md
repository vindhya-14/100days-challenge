# 🌐 DNS Lookup Visualizer

An interactive **DNS Lookup Visualizer** built with **React, Vite, and TailwindCSS**.  
This project demonstrates how DNS resolution works by visualizing each step:  

1. User enters a domain name.  
2. Request flows through DNS hierarchy (Local Cache → Recursive Resolver → Root → TLD → Authoritative Server).  
3. IP address is returned and displayed in a clear, interactive UI.
