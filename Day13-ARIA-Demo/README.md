#  Accessible To-Do List using ARIA Labels

A simple, beginner-friendly **To-Do List web app** that uses **ARIA labels** to make it accessible for screen reader users. This project demonstrates how to build inclusive web components using basic HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and accessibility best practices.


##  What Are ARIA Labels?

**ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications)** labels are special HTML attributes that make web content more accessible to people who use screen readers. They provide extra information about elements, especially when there is no visible text to describe them.


#  Why Do We Need ARIA?
Sometimes, visual elements (like icons or custom buttons) don't clearly tell assistive technologies what they do. ARIA helps by giving extra information about elements so that screen readers can announce them correctly.

# Types
