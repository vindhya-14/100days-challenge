# Graph Algorithms Playground


A lightweight interactive playground that visualizes step-by-step: **BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, Kruskal, Prim**.


Features
- Draw nodes (click), drag nodes, draw edges (drag from a node to another)
- Edit edge weights (prompt while creating an edge)
- Choose algorithm and step through its execution (step / play / pause / speed)
- Visual states: frontier, visited, path, considered edges, MST edges
- Generate random graphs and clear/reset
